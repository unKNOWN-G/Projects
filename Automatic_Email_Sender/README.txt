In This Project My main goal is to create a python code which can automatically send mails to a bunch of recipients from a sender mail
Some perks of this project are
1) You can avoid  using cc,bcc. Thereby you wont be revealing the information that the mail was sent to whom.
2) Bolding text is an important summarization feature to highlight important points . In this project you can bold certain parts of mail and can write the rest in normal which isnt a general feature in normal Automatic Email senders.
3) You can customize each email like mentioning on the top of each mail. "Dear unKNOWN, ".
4) You can schedule your mailing time like always. This is an Alternate way other than the email Scheduler.

Language Used : Python
